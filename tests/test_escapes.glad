# Test 2: Escaping the backtick itself
PRINT `This contains a backtick: \` inside the string` 

# Test 3: Escaping the interpolation marker
PRINT `The value is ${name}`    # Should print: The value is GladLang
PRINT `Use \${name} to interpolate` # Should print: Use ${name} to interpolate

# Test 4: Mixed complex case
