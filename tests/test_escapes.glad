# Test 1: Standard escapes inside backticks
PRINTLN `Line A\nLine B`          # Should print on two lines
PRINTLN `Start\tEnd`              # Should have a tab space

# Test 2: Escaping the backtick itself
PRINTLN `This contains a backtick: \` inside the string` 

# Test 3: Escaping the interpolation marker
PRINTLN `The value is ${name}`    # Should print: The value is GladLang
PRINTLN `Use \${name} to interpolate` # Should print: Use ${name} to interpolate

# Test 4: Mixed complex case
